# oocsi-examples
This repository hosts a growing collection of examples for using OOCSI in the wild. We cover more "out-there" use cases than in the Processing examples provided with the Processing library.

Best is probably to follow this repository to be alerted about new cool ways to use OOCSI.

Cheers! ðŸ˜œ
